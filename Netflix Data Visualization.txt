 Netflix Data Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Netflix data for visual analytics using both R and Python. The provided dataset will be prepared, cleaned, explored, and visualized to gain insights into the most watched genres and the distribution of ratings.

## Tasks

# 1. Data Preparation

- Unzip Dataset: Unzip the provided dataset and rename it to "Netflix_shows_movies."

# 2. Data Cleaning

- **Address Missing Values**: Handle any missing values in the dataset.

# 3. Data Exploration

- **Describe Data**: Generate data descriptions and perform statistical analysis to understand the dataset better.

# 4. Data Visualization

- **Most Watched Genres**: Create visualizations to represent the most watched genres.
- **Ratings Distribution**: Generate visualizations to depict the distribution of ratings.

# 5. R Integration

- **Implement Visualization in R**: Integrate one of the charts or visualizations into R for further analysis.
